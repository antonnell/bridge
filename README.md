# ðŸŒƒ RenBridge
The safe, fast and most secure way to bring cross-chain assets to Ethereum.

## Local Development

RenBridge uses Firebase to store deposit details. You need a firebase key:

`export REACT_APP_FB_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"`

Install dependencies:

`yarn install`

Serve the front-end:

`yarn start`

The front-end should now be live at localhost:3000.
